# Enhancing Antibodyâ€“Antigen Interaction Prediction with Atomic Flexibility

---

## Abstract

Antibodies are indispensable components of the immune system, known for their specific binding to antigens. Beyond their natural immunological functions, they are fundamental in developing vaccines and therapeutic interventions for infectious diseases. The complex architecture of antibodies, particularly their variable regions responsible for antigen recognition, presents significant challenges for computational modeling.

Recent advancements in deep learning have markedly improved protein structure prediction; however, accurately modeling antibodyâ€“antigen (Abâ€“Ag) interactions remains challenging due to the inherent flexibility of antibodies and the dynamic nature of binding processes.  

In this study, we examine the use of predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) scores as indicators of residue and side-chain flexibility to model Abâ€“Ag interactions through a fingerprint-based approach. We demonstrate the significance of flexibility in different antibody-specific tasks, enhancing the predictive accuracy of Abâ€“Ag interaction models by **4%**, resulting in an **AUC-ROC of 92%**. Additionally, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in paratope prediction.

These results emphasize the importance of accounting for conformational flexibility in modeling Abâ€“Ag interactions and show that pLDDT can effectively serve as a proxy for these dynamic features. By optimizing antibody flexibility using pLDDT, antibodies can be engineered to improve affinity or breadth for a specific targetâ€”particularly beneficial against highly variable pathogens such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2.
